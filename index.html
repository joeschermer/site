<date>FEB 17 2019</date>Since all flavors are made from combinations of molecules, let’s think of the molecules as the basic building blocks and create flavors based on that–– based on the underlying molecular structures. Rather than being limited to creating a copy of a copy of some idea of nature, a flavor can be constructed based on its own specific qualities, and this opens up a wide range of new possibilities within the flavor space.<citation>(Raspet, 2018)</citation>
<date>FEB 17 2019</date>The concept of the "machinic phylum" was created in an effort to conceive the genesis of form (in geological, biological and cultural structures) as related exclusively to immanent capabilities of the flows of matter-energy-information and not to any transcendent factor, whether platonic or divine (e.g. the hylomorphic schema). Endogenously-generated stable states, capable of many different physical instantiations, furnish at least some the immanent resources needed for such a theory. Moreover, because attractors are typically not unique (that is, several stable states may be available to a system at once) they form one context in which chance can play a "creative" role, by switching a system in a more or less random way from one deterministic state to another. And at certain critical points of intensity (called "bifurcations"), in which a set of attractors changes into another set, random fluctuations may also play a role, pushing the system from one path to another, giving indeterminism yet another role to play.<citation>(de Landa, 1997)</citation>
<date>FEB 17 2019</date>So, volatility becomes the only certain thing and the only conclusion; volatility becomes the only fundamental value; volatility becomes the commodity and the true stuff that the market is made of. Suddenly, science and quantitative theory move from trying to determine the value of the traded asset, which is impossible because the only thing that exists is its market price, to determining (that is to say, to imagining, to picturing, to conceiving) the volatility of its price.<citation>(Ayache, 2017)</citation>
<date>FEB 17 2019</date>A world of socially particular composite assets such as corporations, mortgages and houses (which now look increasingly ‘primitive’ as forms of finance and capital) is being augmented by a parallel universe of abstract securities (derivatives, structured finance, securitised assets, etc.) and institutions, which unbundle attributes and eviscerate the specificity of their particular points of abstraction. Structured finance permits the deconstruction and recoding of assets and exposures, making not just the ownership properties of an asset tradable, but also many of its spatio-temporal attributes (including the timing, currency, location of institutional ‘owner’ and forms of cash flows).<citation>(Bryan, Rafferty & Wigan, 2016)</citation>
<date>FEB 10 2019</date>Violence turned the public's attention to possible organized crime involvement within the securities markets on October 26, 1999. Stock promoters Maier S. Lehmann and Albert Alain Chalem were found shot to death execution style in a home in Colts Neck, New Jersey. At the time, Lehmann and Chalem ran an Internet web site, Stockinvestor.com, which touted penny stocks. The SEC had previously sued Lehmann for his role in a penny stock manipulation. Chalem had been a broker at A.S. Goldmen, a now-defunct boiler-room operation that has been the subject of both civil and criminal securities fraud charges. While no one has been charged yet in the murders, media reports have cited close ties between Chalem and organized crime.<citation>(U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, 2000)</citation>
