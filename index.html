The Keynesian revolution did not occur because Keynes’ arguments were so compellingly lucid and unanswerable. It was the Great Depression that convinced people that something was wrong with an economic theory that denied the very possibility of involuntary unemployment. Likewise it will probably take a Great Ecological Spasm to convince people that something is wrong with an economic theory that denies the very possibility of an economy exceeding its optimal scale. But even in that unhappy event, it is still necessary to have an alternative vision ready to present when crisis conditions provide a receptive public.

In contrast to ASICs, reconfigurable devices like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can be reprogrammed without limit and can change their functionality even while the system is running. Therefore, they are a very promising technology for integrating dedicated hardware accelerators in existing CPU- and GPU-based computing systems, resulting in so-called <i>High Performance Reconfigurable Computing (HPRC)</i> architectures.

Grass is a fairly recent addition to the planet; and despite the fact most incumbent vegetation towers over it, blocking it from the sun, it's been so successful as to have spread to every continent on the planet, even Antarctica. Owing in no small measure to two very important properties. It's extremely combustible, even known to spontaneously combust; and its tolerance for heat is higher than almost any other form of vegetation; it will be growing again within 48 hours of a forest fire while most other forms of vegetation are dead.

<i>Vessel</i>, Heatherwick’s $150 million not-quite-a-sculpture, not-quite-a-building sits at the center of Hudson Yards’ Public Square and Gardens. The climbable installation is made up of 154 flights of stairs connected to 80 landings, and it balloons up to 150-feet-wide at its 150-foot-tall summit. As project architect Stuart Wood explained, <i>Vessel</i> was designed to be open in its programming while not “jamming up” the plaza. “The project was built entirely from staircases and landings. They’re public, publicly accessible, free to use spaces. It’s non-prescriptive. That was absolutely our intent from the outset. This should be a project that is open to interpretation. It’s open to different natures of use.”

There is no such thing as a structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness&mdash;and that is not the nature of a human group.

If finance (represented by banking or derivatives markets) presents a threat to states, the leading questions are: Why? What is finance power distinct from modern state sovereignty? Since ‘finance’ here is a euphemism for a systemic market-led dynamic organization of capital accumulation, these questions cannot be taken up in terms of the motivations, gains, and losses of those individuals who effectuate financial power and its vicissitudes. Such accounts render opaque the structural and consistent operations of capital accumulation via financial markets by personifying and pathologising the logic and imperatives of capital accumulation, looking past the particular technical and juridical innovations in structure and operation that advance market capitalization.

The maneuver conducted by units of the Israeli military during the attack on the city of Nablus in April 2002 was described by its commander, Brigadier General Aviv Kochavi, as “inverse geometry,” which he explained as the re-organization of the urban syntax by means of a series of micro-tactical actions. During the attack, soldiers moved within the city across hundred-meter-long “over-ground-tunnels” carved out through a dense and contiguous urban fabric. Although several thousand soldiers and hundreds of Palestinian guerrilla fighters were maneuvering simultaneously in the city, they were saturated within its fabric to the degree that most would not have been visible from an aerial perspective at any given moment. Furthermore, soldiers did not often use the streets, roads, alleys, or courtyards that constitute the syntax of the city, as well as the external doors, internal stairwells, and windows that constitute the order of buildings, but rather moved horizontally through party walls, and vertically through holes blasted in ceilings and floors.

Since all flavors are made from combinations of molecules, let’s think of the molecules as the basic building blocks and create flavors based on that&mdash;based on the underlying molecular structures. Rather than being limited to creating a copy of a copy of some idea of nature, a flavor can be constructed based on its own specific qualities, and this opens up a wide range of new possibilities within the flavor space.

The concept of the “machinic phylum” was created in an effort to conceive the genesis of form (in geological, biological and cultural structures) as related exclusively to immanent capabilities of the flows of matter-energy-information and not to any transcendent factor, whether platonic or divine (e.g. the hylomorphic schema). Endogenously-generated stable states, capable of many different physical instantiations, furnish at least some of the immanent resources needed for such a theory. Moreover, because attractors are typically not unique (that is, several stable states may be available to a system at once) they form one context in which chance can play a “creative” role, by switching a system in a more or less random way from one deterministic state to another. And at certain critical points of intensity (called “bifurcations”), in which a set of attractors changes into another set, random fluctuations may also play a role, pushing the system from one path to another, giving indeterminism yet another role to play.

So, volatility becomes the only certain thing and the only conclusion; volatility becomes the only fundamental value; volatility becomes the commodity and the true stuff that the market is made of. Suddenly, science and quantitative theory move from trying to determine the value of the traded asset, which is impossible because the only thing that exists is its market price, to determining (that is to say, to imagining, to picturing, to conceiving) the volatility of its price.

A world of socially particular composite assets such as corporations, mortgages and houses (which now look increasingly ‘primitive’ as forms of finance and capital) is being augmented by a parallel universe of abstract securities (derivatives, structured finance, securitised assets, etc.) and institutions, which unbundle attributes and eviscerate the specificity of their particular points of abstraction. Structured finance permits the deconstruction and recoding of assets and exposures, making not just the ownership properties of an asset tradable, but also many of its spatio-temporal attributes (including the timing, currency, location of institutional ‘owner’ and forms of cash flows).

Violence turned the public's attention to possible organized crime involvement within the securities markets on October 26, 1999. Stock promoters Maier S. Lehmann and Albert Alain Chalem were found shot to death execution style in a home in Colts Neck, New Jersey. At the time, Lehmann and Chalem ran an Internet web site, Stockinvestor.com, which touted penny stocks. The SEC had previously sued Lehmann for his role in a penny stock manipulation. Chalem had been a broker at A.S. Goldmen, a now-defunct boiler-room operation that has been the subject of both civil and criminal securities fraud charges. While no one has been charged yet in the murders, media reports have cited close ties between Chalem and organized crime.
